    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about my approach and services",
    "q1": "Do you only do AI, or do you also support design and user experience?",
    "a1": "No, I don't just do AI.\n\nAI is just one lever among others in my global approach: UX, UI, API integration, automation, and performance.\n\nMy role is to create complete experiences ‚Äî where AI naturally blends into the user journey to make it smoother, smarter, and more profitable.\n\nüëâ In short: I design useful products, not AI demos.",
    "q2": "What are your rates and what do they specifically include?",
    "a2": "Each offer is packaged around a result, not a number of hours.\n\nYou choose a format (POC, complete experience, or support), and everything is included:\n\n‚Ä¢ UX/UI design\n‚Ä¢ AI integration (Claude, Mistral, OpenAI‚Ä¶)\n‚Ä¢ Automations and connectors (n8n, APIs, smart forms)\n‚Ä¢ Documentation and transfer\n\nNo hidden fees, no surprise billing ‚Äî just a measurable deliverable.",
    "q3": "How long does it take to deliver a project, and how do you handle technical setbacks?",
    "a3": "An express POC: 7 to 14 days.\n\nA complete project: 3 to 6 weeks, broken down into short sprints (1 to 2 weeks).\n\nEach mission starts with precise scoping to avoid gray areas.\n\nIn case of unforeseen issues (APIs, data, external dependencies), I always plan a backup to never block delivery.\n\nMy approach: fast, agile, but always structured.",
    "q4": "What about after delivery? Do you offer maintenance or follow-up?",
    "a4": "Yes ‚Äî each project is delivered clean and documented, but I also offer:\n\n‚Ä¢ An evolving maintenance contract (updates, fixes, new AI/UX features)\n‚Ä¢ Monthly support to grow your product\n\nYou keep control of your code and infrastructure, I remain in technical or strategic support according to your needs.\n\nThe goal: for your product to live long and stay performant.",
    "q5": "How do I know if my idea or project is ready to work with you?",
    "a5": "Even if your idea isn't fully defined yet, we can move forward.\n\nI offer a quick scoping workshop to clarify your need, identify the right level of automation, and validate AI feasibility.\n\nWe can then decide:\n\n‚Ä¢ Either to do a quick POC to test the concept\n‚Ä¢ Or to directly build a complete experience\n\nThe important thing is to start small, prove, then scale ‚Äî not wait for perfection."
